#xfertax

I made this to learn some basics of Foundation.

It's a single page js app to calculate transfer tax and sale prices
for land transactions by date.

## Installation

docker build -t my-repo/my-image-name:my-version .

docker run --name my-container -d my-repo/my-image-name:my-version

## This is a test
I think I can just edit and make a PR, right?
